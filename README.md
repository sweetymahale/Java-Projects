Full stack web application using Spring Boot and React. In this application, I have used Spring Boot ( MVC, JPA, Hibernate) and Mysql Database to create the Backend application (Restful web service API) with and use React.js to create the frontend application with Material UI and React Hooks( useState, useEffect) with functional components. I have build simple full stack project with RESTful Web services API and also use fetch (you can use axios) for consuming REST API.
